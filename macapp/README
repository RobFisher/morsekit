The macapp directory contains tools for creating a distributable app bundle
that should work at least on Snow Leopard.

Simply run ./macapp.sh and the bundle will be created by copying files.

I have avoided using py2app for now because using OSX's built-in Python
seems neater and I have not yet found a good reason not to.

Py2app requires installing non-system Python with MacPorts. I can switch to
this later if necessary.
