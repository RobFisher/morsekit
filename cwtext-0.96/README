CWTEXT 0.96 README

This is cwtext version 0.96. The software converts plain ASCII to 
International Morse Code. This release includes three programs,

cwtext: convert text to 'dotscii' - . -..- -
cwpcm: convert text to PCM audio stream
cwmm: convert to MorseMail XML format
	see http://www.seanet.com/~harrypy/MorseMail/ for information
	on this excellent program.

License: GPL

Binary installation:
Just run 'make install' to install the programs to /usr/local/bin.
To install elsewhere edit the makefile, change the prefix from
/usr/local to whatever you like.

Source installation:
'make install' should build the programs and install to /usr/local/bin
as above. This is a simple program and should work anywhere, as long
as you have a reasonable CLIB. Python is only required if you want
to change the symbol table.

Uses of CWTEXT:

cat message | cwtext | mail root@localhost -s "test message in morse code"
	Convert local file 'message' to 'dotscii' and mail to root.

finger @finger.kernel.org | cwpcm > /dev/dsp
	Get the latest Linux kernel version numbers, convert to
	morse and send to the sound card.

cat COPYING | cwpcm -ss -f 800 -lowrez | sox -r 8000 -bu -t raw - copying.wav lowp 1800
	Convert the text file COPYING to morse code in 'copying.wav'
	audio file. The CW signal is at 800 Hz. Sox converts the audio
	to a .wav file and applies low pass filter to eliminate key click.

echo vvv | cwpcm -w 20 -F 24 -lowrez | dsp-lowpass
	Test signal at 20 wpm, characters at 24 wpm. dsp-lowpass is a 
	script that uses sox to filter key click and send the output
	to /dev/dsp.

cwpcm interface:
-f FFFF to set the output frequency (40 to 3200 Hz)
-w NN	to set the rate (WPM)
-F NN	to set the character (Farnsworth) rate
-v NN	to set the volume (0-100%)
-lowrez output at 8000 samples/second (default is 44100)
-d	debug: shows settings for speed, frequency and volume

(classic interface - works for now but deprecated)
-ss for slow code rate (5 wpm, characters at farnsworth 15 wpm)
-sm for medium code rate (12 wpm, characters at 18 wpm)
-sf for fast code rate (18 wpm)
-sx for extra fast code rate (20 wpm)
-f:FFFF to set the output frequency

Version 0.96
Added envelope support: no more keyclick!
Prosign support: use *sk* for example.
Default bitrate is now 44100. To get the old 8000 bitrate use -lowrez.

Version 0.95
NOW: you can set the WPM and Farnsworth rates to whatever you like!
Set the volume to 0-100%. Volume greater than 90 may cause clipping.
More accurate frequency generation (KC6HUR)
Added test for frequency. If you need >2000Hz you will have to
increase the bitrate accordingly. Set it to at least 4 times your 
desired maximum frequency.

NEW in 0.94
Got the farnsworth timing right! Changed slow code rate to
5 wpm with characters at 15 wpm.

NEW in 0.93
cwmm MorseMail converter.

NEW in 0.92 for cwpcm
-f:NNNN set the pitch to NNNN (40 to 3200) in Hz.
