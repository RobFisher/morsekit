MorseKit by Rob Fisher
----------------------

Uses cwtext by rsbohn
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cwtext/

The idea is to develop a suite of tools for generating morse
code to practise with. Since I am learning Morse code with
the Koch method, to start with I will make some scripts that
generate words of various lengths with selected letters and
play them out at a configurable speed. Later, a Python/Tk UI
might be nice.

Developing on a Mac, but ultimately this should work cross-
platform.

So far:

Get started (on a Mac):
sudo port install sox
cd cwtext-0.96
make
cd ..
mactest.sh "Some text"
